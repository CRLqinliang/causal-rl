# Toy problem 1 (door)

This toy problem is configured in the following file:
```
experiments/toy1/config.json
```

To run this experiment execute the following commands:
```shell
GPU = 0  # -1 for CPU

for EXPERT in noisy_good perfect_good perfect_bad random strong_bad_bias strong_good_bias; do
  for SEED in {0..19}; do
    python experiments/toy1/01_train_models.py $EXPERT -s $SEED -g $GPU
    python experiments/toy1/02_eval_models.py $EXPERT -s $SEED -g $GPU
  done
  (Optional) python experiments/toy1/03_kallus_et_al.py $EXPERT 
  python experiments/toy1/04_plots.py $EXPERT (Optional) --kallus=True

```
experiments/
  toy1/
    plots/
	results/
    trained_models/
```
